## What?

You want to get access to curated lists of people to follow on Twitter, which are kept up to date, on any subject of your choice. These could be to keep you informed, or to learn about a new subject, to discover a new market, you name it.

## How?

We offer lists of 50 accounts curated by our team and our partners: these lists are updated every week to ensure you get the best of them. You'll be able to rate the lists you subscribed to, see each list ratings, and unsubscribe any time you want.

## Why?

You could maintain your own, or build them with your friends, but this is time consuming and consensus might be harder to reach than you think. And when diving into new subjects, the quantity of accounts available can be overwhelming.
